				<h3>Instructions</h3>

				<h4>Creating/Joining a room</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>To start a game, create a new room or join an existing one.</li>

					<li>
						To invite other players to join your game, click on the &quot;invite
						players&quot; or &quot;room code&quot; button. This will copy an
						invite link that you can then send to the players you wish to
						invite. They can click on the link to join your game and start
						playing with you. You can also share the room code with players if
						you prefer, which they can enter on the main menu to join your game.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>The game itself</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Players take turns selecting &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;dare&quot;
						from the options provided.
					</li>

					<li>
						After selecting a truth or dare, you will be given an instruction to
						follow.
					</li>

					<ul>
						<li>
							If the instruction requires you to do something physical, you can
							either screen share, record a video, or turn on your webcam to
							show the group.
						</li>

						<li>
							If the instruction is a truth, you can answer it in the chat
							message or via voice if you are playing in a face-to-face setting.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<li>
						Players may also use the chat feature to communicate with each other
						and share their experiences during the game.
					</li>

					<li>
						Continue taking turns and completing truths or dares until all
						players have had a chance to participate.
					</li>

					<li>Have fun and enjoy the game!</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>The Party Leaders</h4>

				<p>
					The party leader, who will be indicated by a crown icon beside their
					name, has the ability to kick players from the room and force skip a
					player&apos;s turn. These actions should only be used in appropriate
					circumstances to ensure that all players are having a fair and
					enjoyable experience.
				</p>

				<h4>The ability to re-roll</h4>
				<p>
					Players have the option to re-roll their truth or dare if they are not
					satisfied with their original selection. This can be done without
					skipping their turn, but should be used sparingly to allow other
					players a fair chance to play as well. We encourage players to
					carefully consider their original selection before choosing to
					re-roll.
				</p>

				<h3>Recommended way to play</h3>
				<p>
					While Troof offers chat functionality, it is still best played in a
					scenario where players can communicate with each other face-to-face.
					This added level of interaction and engagement enhances the excitement
					and thrill of the game, making it an unforgettable experience for
					players.
				</p>

				<p>That&quot;s basically it</p>
