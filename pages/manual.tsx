				<h4>Creating/Joining a room</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						To start a game, create a new room or join an existing
						one.
					</li>

					<li>
						To invite other players to join your game, click on the
						&quot;invite players&quot; or &quot;room code&quot;
						button. This will copy an invite link that you can then
						send to the players you wish to invite. They can click
						on the link to join your game and start playing with
						you. You can also share the room code with players if
						you prefer, which they can enter on the main menu to
						join your game.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>The game itself</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Players take turns selecting &quot;truth&quot; or
						&quot;dare&quot; from the options provided.
					</li>

					<li>
						After selecting a truth or dare, you will be given an
						instruction to follow.
					</li>

					<ul>
						<li>
							If the instruction requires you to do something
							physical, you can either screen share, record a
							video, or turn on your webcam to show the group.
						</li>

						<li>
							If the instruction is a truth, you can answer it in
							the chat message or via voice if you are playing in
							a face-to-face setting.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<li>
						Players may also use the chat feature to communicate
						with each other and share their experiences during the
						game.
					</li>

					<li>
						Continue taking turns and completing truths or dares
						until all players have had a chance to participate.
					</li>

					<li>Have fun and enjoy the game!</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>The Party Leaders</h4>

				<p>
					The party leader, who will be indicated by a crown icon
					beside their name, has the ability to kick players from the
					room and force skip a player&apos;s turn. These actions
					should only be used in appropriate circumstances to ensure
					that all players are having a fair and enjoyable experience.
				</p>

				<h4>The ability to re-roll</h4>
				<p>
					Players have the option to re-roll their truth or dare if
					they are not satisfied with their original selection. This
					can be done without skipping their turn, but should be used
					sparingly to allow other players a fair chance to play as
					well. We encourage players to carefully consider their
					original selection before choosing to re-roll.
				</p>

				<h3>Recommended way to play</h3>
				<p>
					While Troof offers chat functionality, it is still best
					played in a scenario where players can communicate with each
					other face-to-face. This added level of interaction and
					engagement enhances the excitement and thrill of the game,
					making it an unforgettable experience for players.
				</p>

				<p>That&quot;s basically it</p>
